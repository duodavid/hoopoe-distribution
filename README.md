## Run
The progam uses agents (hoopoes) to scout the environment. The environment is based on the data in the layers that are referencing the reallife environemnt.
The agents are given characteristics of typical hoopoes when choosing a place to stay. Based on these characteristics the agents select places in the environment where 
a hoopoe could be seen. The data are georeferenced, so you view the exact position using a geographical informations system. The program uses data with WGS 84 EPSG:4326 as the coordinate reference system. 

## Software stack
This project is build on the C# multi-agent simulation framework MARS (Multi-Agent Research and Simulation) which provides all foundational structures to build a simulation environment with its agents and entities. The code for the simulation itself is written in C# whereas the visualization is written in python.
To run the program your system needs the following requirements.

- [Mars Live-Simulation 4.1.3 beta](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Mars.Life.Simulations/4.3.1-beta#readme-body-tab)
- [.Net 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)

## How to setup?

### Simulation
1.  Download the repository from the Gitlab page

	If you have installed Git on your operating system, you can execute the following command in your console to clone the program:

	```bash
	 git clone .....
	 ```

	If Git is not installed on your system, you can download the game directly from our [repository](....) by clicking on the download icon in the right upper corner of the main page and download the game as a .zip file.

2. Open the programm
	After the download is finished, start your prefered C# IDE and open the project. We recommend you to use [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/rider/), but any other C# IDE will do it too.

	          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ...
	```

3. In the situation that you dont know where to set the spawnpoints of the agents, set then variable runSim in Programm.cs to false and configure the parameters of the CreateSpawnpoints method in the "else"-block. 
   (Make sure the path to the spawnpoints.csv file is correct)

4. Before you start the simulation make sure to check the configuration (config.json) of the program. The files for the corresponding layers have to be in directly "Ressource" folder (no nesting) and the numbers at the  end of each filename have to be the same or the resulting data will be incorrect. The result files can be nested as long as the path in the congifuration file is correct. The result files are a copy of the "meadow" files, but named differently to differentiate the two.

- Quick explanation for the different configuration that are NOT path to files. Usually MARS provides a section for layer and agents in the configuration. 
  But given the amount agents it takes to long to calculate the spawnpoints and rastersize of each agent (that are written in the spawnpoints.csv). Additonally 
  to run hundreds if not thousands of agent can be quite exhausting for some computers. Thats why agents are created one by one manually in the LandscapLayer 
  and it is recommended that you only spawn a few hundred agents at most and run the simulation multiple times:
  - AgentCount: The amount of agents you want to spawn.
  - Startpoint: The starting point you want the agents at. 
  - RasterWidth: The raster width each agent has.
  - RasterLength: The raster length each agent has.
  - MinRasterSize: Rasters can not alway be the same size given the file you use. Rasters are allowed to be smaller than what you have set in the previous points.
                   this one sets the minimim of raster.  Example 7= 7x7 tiles/pixel.
  - PercentageTiles: The least amount of meadow tiles a hoopoe agent has to find for a raster to be recognized as liveable.
  - MinHeigth: The preferred minimum height of a tile.
  - MaxHeight: The preferred maximum height of a tile.
  - TreeCount: Hoopoes use tree for there nest but it is hard to check each tree condition. TreeCount is the required amount of trees in a given raster to be     considered liveable.
  - To get numbers of agents you need to check the entire file use these calculations: 
    - number of agents required: (length of file x width of file) / number of tiles for raster
    - number of tiles for raster: raster length in meters / 5 (Example: 6000m¬≤ / 5m¬≤ = 1200) 
  

5. You should be able to run the programm.


## Visualize
The programm is created in close dependency using QGIS (https://www.qgis.org/de/site/). So to visualize everything you have to download the programm, create a new project and drag the "OpenStreetMap" layer on the left side
to your workbench, to display the world map. To visualize the data that are used in the program, drag the files to qgis. 

(If the files are displayed incorrectly, make sure the project crs (german:kbs) is in the format WGS 84 EPSG:4326)
